		<p id="musicDescr">Outside of technology music is a big interest of mine.
		it's very rare for me to not be listening to music when I am working on something.
		I mainly listen to Rock and Metal and that includes any end of the spectrum from bands like
		Fleetwood Mac and Genesis to Slipknot and Amon Amarth
