			<h1>Listing 2048</h1>
			<p>Paradise found! This custom-built brand new home sits proudly on a 6.8-acre
			high wooded site overlooking a 300-acre nature conservancy. The setting is
			exceptional, and the home is every bit as exciting! A bright, open layout is 
			enhanced by vaulted ceilings, hardwood and tumbled, ceramic flooring, custom 
			maple cabinetry, upgraded fixtures, numerous windows, and incredible views.
			
			There is much more. The property includes a 40x54 storage building - perfect
			for a large boat and machinery. An exposed walkout on lower level leads down to
			a beautiful wooded area.
			
			An extra bathroom, bedroom, and family room can be added to the unfinished 
			basement for more living space.</p>
