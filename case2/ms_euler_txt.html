		<h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

		<P>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
		<strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
		he studied under another giant of mathematics,<strong>Jean 
		Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
		and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
		Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
		publishing over <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His 
		influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
		
		He is perhaps best known for his research into 
		mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
		<cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, 
		remained a standard textbook in the field for 
		well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
		he wrote 
		<cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, 
		giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
		physical theories of the time.
		
		One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
		copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
		as <var>e</var> and <var>&pi;</var>, were introduced 
		in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
		leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
		certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

				<h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

				Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:

				<code>cos(<var>x</var>)+<var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>)=<var>e</var>^<sup><var>xi</var></sup></code>

				which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
				complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
				equation, it's easy to derive the identity:

				<code><var>e</var>^<var><sup>&pi;</var><var>i</sup></var>+1=0</code>
				
				which relates the fundamental constants: 
				0, 1, <var>&pi;</var>, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and 
				elegant statement. A poll of readers 
				conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite>
				magazine named Euler's Identity as the 
				most beautiful theorem in the history of 
				mathematics.
